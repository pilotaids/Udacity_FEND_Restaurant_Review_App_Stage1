# Udacity FEND Restaurant Reviews Project
The **Restaurant Reviews** projects is a three stage project converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

The material presented here is the product produced after Stage 1 of 3.
In **Stage 1** we have taken an initial static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different
sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
During this stage we also added a service worker handling the initial caching beginning the process of creating a
seamless offline experience for your users.


## How to run the application
To run the web app the user will need to have Python (version 2 or 3) installed.
If the user does not have the required software, it can be easily downloaded from Python's [website](https://www.python.org/).
Once Python is running, the user will need to open up the terminal, and lunch the server, based on the installed version of Python (run `python -V` to check).
-	For Python 2.x run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use);
-	For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`.

Once the server is running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to view the app.


## For Developers
If you are a developer, and you'd like to get your 'hands dirty', feel free to look around the different directories.
This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) which is free to use, and does not
require any payment information, but the code has some extra methods and functions (currently commented out) that can be used with Google Maps.
